        <h1>What is Carbon Footprint?</h1>
        <p>
            A carbon footprint is the total amount of greenhouse gases, particularly carbon dioxide (CO2), that are emitted directly or indirectly by human activities. These activities include burning fossil fuels for electricity, transportation, heating, and manufacturing, as well as other processes such as deforestation and industrial agriculture.
        </p>

        <p>
            Carbon footprints are typically measured in units of carbon dioxide equivalents (CO2e), which represent the amount of CO2 that would have the same global warming potential as the other greenhouse gases emitted. Understanding and reducing our carbon footprint is important for mitigating climate change and minimizing our impact on the environment
        </p>
        <h2>Why is it necessary to reduce the carbon footprints?</h2>
        <p>
            Its a well-known fact that carbon emissions have a devastating effect on our environment. Reducing GHG(greenhouse gases) emissions can effectively slow down the rates of rising global temperatures, it can help restore balance to rising sea levels, slow down the melting of polar ice caps, and prevent ocean acidification
        </p>
        <p>
            Its estimated that the ocean absorbs about 30% of the carbon dioxide (CO2) released into the atmosphere, which decreases the pH of the ocean and in turn, increases its acidity.

        </p>
        <p>
            Reducing GHG emissions is fundamental to lessening the severity of weather anomalies due to climate change and improving the quality of air and water needed for sustaining life, maintaining biodiversity, and a healthy food supply.
